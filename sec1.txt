CHAPTER 1: Introduction to JavaScript
SECTION 1: Usage and Variables

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to add functionality to webpages. It is dynamically-typed, and considered by many to be easy to learn. To start, you can create a variable in JavaScript with:

let x = 5;

where 'x' is the name of the variable, and '5' is the value that we want it to hold. The 'let' tells JavaScript that we want to create a variable, and the equals sign assigns it to 5. In this case, 'x' is a number, because its value is the number 5. We can also have other types of variables:

let a = "Hello, I'm a string!";
let b = 12.12952;
let c = false;

In these cases, a, b, and c represent a String, a Number, and a Boolean respectively. A String value holds text, which can include words and numbers. A Number is any kind of number, like an integer or a decimal. A Boolean stores one simple state: true or false. A Boolean can't be any other value.
